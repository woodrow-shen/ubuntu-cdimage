# syncing a local Ubuntu mirror; see etc/anonftpsync (or
# production/anonftpsync if it exists) for settings affecting what is
# mirrored and where.

# This will eventually become a more declarative configuration file.  In the
# meantime, do not add new variable settings to this file unless you also
# update lib/cdimage/config.py, or unless their names start with "CDIMAGE_"
# and they are exported to the environment.
