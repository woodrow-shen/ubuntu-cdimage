"""PID files containing multiple PIDs.

This implements two operations, namely test-add (test non-empty, add PID,
return state of test) and remove-test (remove PID, test non-empty, return
state of test), which are sufficient for use as a shared lock which only
opens when all users have unlocked.  Dead processes are automatically
ignored and removed.  It is an error to call test-add with a PID that is
already in the file, or remove-test with a PID that is not already in the
file.

The state is returned on stdout; a non-zero exit status indicates an error.
